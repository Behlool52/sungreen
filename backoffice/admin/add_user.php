  Hello $name,<br /><br />
  <strong>Welcome to the EarthSave community</strong><br /><br />
  We are delighted to introduce our Earthsave  portal where you can view your work-orders, update STC and communicate with admin in a hassle-free environment.<br />

  <strong>Username:</strong> $username<br />

  (It is advised to keep your credentials  safe at all times. Should you need to change your password, contact the admin department without any delays)<br /><br />
  INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
