                                   <h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>When investing in a solar installation for your business, reliability and long-term performance are a key concern. Our industry-leading manufacturing facilities and processes ensure our products meet the highest quality standards. REC Peak Energy solar panels provide you with complete peace of mind that you have made a sound investment.</p>

									<h3>Features</h3>
									<p>
									</p><h4>ROBUST &amp; DURABLE DESIGN</h4>
									<p>
									As the largest European brand of solar panels, we pride ourselves on the quality of our products. REC panels are engineered to withstand heavy loads and wind, with the frame designed to prevent frost damage and facilitate snow slippage. Furthermore, REC panels undergo harsh internal testing – ensuring they perform strongly in the most severe environments and avoid damage during handling.</p>

									<h4>OPTIMIZED FOR ALL SUNLIGHT CONDITIONS</h4>
									<p>Even in low and diffuse sunlight conditions such as sunrise, sunset and cloudy weather, REC Peak Energy panels deliver strong power output, thanks to innovative technologies at both cell and panel level.</p>

									<h4>ENERGY PAYBACK TIME OF ONE YEAR</h4>
									<p>REC Peak Energy panels provide a great boost to your environmental initiatives as they have a low CO2 footprint and an industry-leading energy payback time of around one year. This means that after just one year of operation, one REC Peak Energy panel will have produced the same amount of energy that was required to produce the panel itself. After that, it's all energy profit.</p>

                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>The 72-cell panels based on the award-winning REC TwinPeak technologies are bigger in size, deliver even higher power output per m2, and are ideally suited for commercial and industrial applications worldwide.</p>

									<h3>Features</h3>
									
									<p>Installers, EPCs, investors, and end customers will experience its advantages almost immediately, including lower balance of system costs and higher yield thanks to its increased power output and improved performance in shaded conditions, enabled by the innovative ‘twin’ design.</p>
									
									<p>
									</p><h4>MORE POWER OUTPUT PER M2</h4>
									<p>
									The advanced technologies packed into the REC TwinPeak 72 provide you with much more power output for every square meter of panels installed, compared to standard 72-cell panels on a multicrystalline (poly) platform. The REC TwinPeak 2S 72 Series is the most powerful 72-cell multicrystalline panel in the world.</p>

									<h4>MORE PERFORMANCE IN SHADED CONDITIONS</h4>
									<p>Panels based on REC TwinPeak technologies have a unique “twin” design, which enables them to generate electricity even when they are partially shaded. Over time, you get a higher yield from your installation.</p>

									<h4>MORE COST EFFICIENT</h4>
									<p>By delivering more power per square meter, you need fewer REC TwinPeak 72 panels to generate the same power. This means quicker installation times and the need for fewer components such as clamps and racks. All of which reduces your overall costs, shortening the payback time.</p><p>

                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>Bigger isn't always better, but in some cases it pays to have that bit more. The REC Peak Energy 72 is the bigger brother of the 60-cell REC Peak Energy, with solar cells arranged in 12 rows of 6. The 72-cell panel is bigger in size, delivers more power, and is perfectly suited to commercial and industrial applications.</p>

									<h3>Features</h3>
									<p>
									</p><h4>MORE POWER OUTPUT PER M2</h4>
									<p>
									Because of their larger size and higher power, you need fewer panels to achieve the same system size than if you were to use standard 60-cell panels. Or just generate even more power if you stick with the same number of panels.</p>

									<h4>ROBUST AND DURABLE DESIGN</h4>
									<p>As the largest European brand of solar panels, we pride ourselves on the quality of our products. REC panels are engineered to withstand heavy loads and wind, with the frame designed to prevent frost damage and facilitate snow slippage. Furthermore, REC panels undergo harsh internal testing – ensuring they perform strongly in the most severe environments and avoid damage during handling.</p>

									<h4>MORE COST EFFICIENT</h4>
									<p>The addition of two extra rows of cells in REC Peak Energy 72 solar panels means that more area can be covered during installation at a faster rate, meaning quicker installation times and the need for fewer components such as clamps and racks. All of which reduce your overall costs.</p><p>
